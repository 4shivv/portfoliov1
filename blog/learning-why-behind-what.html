                When most aspiring developers are learning, whether in a data structures course or exploring a new programming language, our natural instinct is to figure out: what is this, and how does it work? That's a solid start. For the longest time, this has been exactly how I approached new concepts up until recently.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the software development world, there are various tools that solve the same problems, such as different frameworks, languages, or even entire stacks that all build similar apps. For instance, Java and C++ share many core programming principles. So when developers make architectural choices—say, choosing React over Vue or PostgreSQL over MongoDB—we're often forced to ask the deeper question: "Why this approach over another?" It hit me that we shouldn't wait until project decision-making to ask "why." We should be asking it as we learn alongside the "what."
            </p>

            <h2>The Power of Understanding "Why"</h2>
            
            <p>
                Understanding why something exists gives you a level of clarity that goes beyond memorization:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>It shows you the problem the concept or tool was designed to solve.</li>
                <li>It reveals the trade-offs and limitations baked into the design.</li>
                <li>It helps build intuition, making it easier to pick the right tool later—even if it's one you've never used.</li>
                <li>It reinforces transferable knowledge instead of siloed facts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>An Example: JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
            
            <p>
                Recently, I was trying to brush up on Javascript basics and approached the topic: What is hoisting? Hoisting in JavaScript is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. But then I asked myself a subtle but important question because I couldn't see it in the moment: why did JavaScript's creators build it this way?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By asking this simple question, I learned that hoisting wasn't a quirky afterthought—it was intentional to allow functions and variables to be available before the code runs, giving the engine a chance to set up scopes in a single parsing pass. In practice, this means:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Early binding of functions, so you can call a function before its declaration, making the code flow more natural.</li>
                <li>Consistent scope setup, ensuring that variables declared anywhere in a function are recognized from the start, preventing unexpected reference errors.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Seeing hoisting as a deliberate trade-off instead of a magical rule transformed my perspective. I stopped thinking, "Ugh, hoisting is confusing," and started thinking, "Ah, this exists to give JS its flexible, forgiving nature during execution."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What felt like a simple concept suddenly had a purpose. And by understanding that purpose, I wasn't just memorizing behavior—I was internalizing how the language thinks.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>
                That one moment helped me realize that even the smallest concepts can unlock deeper understanding when you lead with why. You not only avoid hype-driven choices but also make more strategic decisions in your own project architecture.
