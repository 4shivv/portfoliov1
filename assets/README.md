# Resume Files

This directory contains resume-related files for the portfolio.

## Using an Existing PDF File

If you already have a PDF version of your resume:

1. Simply place your PDF file in this directory
2. Rename it to `shivaganesh_nagamandla_resume.pdf`
3. The PDF will now be accessible from the "Resume" link in the navigation bar

## HTML to PDF Conversion (Alternative)

If you need to create a PDF from the HTML template:

1. Open the `resume.html` file in Chrome or another modern browser
2. Press Ctrl+P (Windows) or Cmd+P (Mac) to open the print dialog
3. Change the destination to "Save as PDF"
4. Save the file as `shivaganesh_nagamandla_resume.pdf` in this directory

## Notes

- The HTML template is styled to work well for PDF conversion if needed
- Update both the PDF and the main index.html when making content changes
