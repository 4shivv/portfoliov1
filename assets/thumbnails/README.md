# Project Thumbnails

Place your project thumbnail images in this directory using the following naming convention:

- `retriv-thumbnail.jpg` - Thumbnail for the Retriv.ai project
- `lyriclingo-thumbnail.jpg` - Thumbnail for the LyricLingo project
- `slumber-thumbnail.jpg` - Thumbnail for the Slumber project

## Image Guidelines

- Recommended image size: 600x400 pixels
- Format: JPG or PNG (JPG preferred for better performance)
- File size: Keep under 200KB for optimal loading speed
- Style: Consistent style across all thumbnails will give your portfolio a cohesive look
- Content: Screenshots of your projects in action work best

If you don't have actual screenshots yet, you can use placeholder images or create simple branded thumbnails with project logos until you have real screenshots available.
